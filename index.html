                <h2>Big Question: How do I Function?</h2>
                <p>I, the Secretory Vessles release proteins and move molecules outside of the cell. I am also triggered by a nervous or hormonal signal. In other words, I am the storage and transport of cell contents, isn't that very cool?!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="structure-song" id="songs">
                <h2>Did you know, I listen to music too?!!</h2>
                <p>I tell you what, my favorite song is the one and only: Blinding Lights by The Weekend!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="structure-hobby" id="hobbies">
                <h2>I might as well tell you my hobbies too!</h2>
                <p>As my job is to store and transport all the proteins and unwanted molecules for the cell, my favorite hobby as you can tell, is being active and productive. Without these two qualities, I don't think a cell would be able to function flawlessly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="structure-best" id="best-one">
                <h2>Why I am the Best Organelle!</h2>
                <p>Now given all these reasons, it is safe to say, I am the best organelle ever! Without me, there would not be as much stability and longevity in the cells today. It is clear and reasonable that cells would need an organelle like me  for maintainence.</p>
